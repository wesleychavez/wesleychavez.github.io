### About
Hi I'm Wesley Chavez, and I like training robots to predict things. My skills lie in computer vision, but recently I've been fascinated with natural language processing.  I have a cat named Ellie and $43 left of AWS credits from taking a survey once.  (Let's see how far that takes us during the course of this blog.)

I am a **potato**.  I struggled to learn about machine learning.  The concepts and the math are not intuitive, and like a scientist, I researched every single publication on Google Scholar that was even loosely related to a topic I was interested in.  In many publications that I read, I felt there was an inadequate transfer of knowledge from the ideas in the paper to my brain.  I was thinking things like, "Why are the equations from these two papers slightly different if they claimed they were doing the exact same thing?" and "Where did they introduce this alpha term!" and "Maybe someone that cited this paper will have a better explanation."  Then I hear or read another explanation and it suddenly *clicks*.  

Reading five papers on the same topic in order to understand it is absolutely tiresome.  I'm here to offer you a one-stop shop for understanding machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and statistics because I believe I can make some of the math seem more intuitive for my grandma and other potatoes like her.
