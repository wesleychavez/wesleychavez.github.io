If you only have time to read one blog post, I'll give you the TLDR (too long, didn't read) in advance: machine learning systems are just boxes.  Boxes with inputs and outputs.  The inputs are the data that you as a data wizard possess, such as a picture, a document of text, a sound recording, a video, etc.  The outputs are the box's guesses.  These guesses can be answers to literally anything, such as, "How many dogs are in this picture?" or, "Are these words about Rosa Parks or Ke$ha?".  You know, the important questions.  You can handcraft solutions to these questions without machine learning (if the document includes the words "bus" or "Montgomery", it's probably about Rosa Parks), but that is too time-consuming and there is too much variation in real-world data to be doing that.  So you take these boxes, shove a ton of data on the side marked "IN" so that the box can learn, and for each piece of data (a picture, a document) that you shove in, a guess pops out the other side.  You compare this guess to the real answer, tweak some knobs inside the box (in the correct direction), and the box gets better at guessing.  The more data you have with ground truth annotations (sticky notes that say the actual number of dogs in each picture), the better your box can get at guessing.  That’s it.  You know everything about machine learning.  

But really, as we go on this data adventure together, I want you to keep in mind the box analogy, because that’s all machine learning really is.  In this blog, I will show you the different types and sizes of boxes for different scenarios, different ways to clean your data before shoving it into the box, and most importantly, how the box even works.  So grab a box and come with meeeeeeee!

After writing this post, I realized that a box isn’t the best analogy, as it’s only a container without “inputs” and “outputs”, but that’s how I think of machine learning, so DEAL WITH IT.  Here’s another one.
